## Problem with the Original Protocol
The original protocol does not prevent playback attacks. 
In order to tackle this, we introduced a nonce into our system. The nonce is generated by the client and encrypted before beign sent to the server.

## Prerequisites
Java is required to run the program. This program was created in JDK 13 and higher.

## Compiling the Program

Compile the program using the `javac` command

```
javac ClientCP1.java ClientCP2.java ServerCP1.java ServerCP2.java ClientAP.java ServerAP.java

```

## Running the Program

To run, open two separate terminal instances, one to run the Client script and the other to run the Server.
First, navigate to the correct directory i.e. `cd PA2\PA2`

### For CP1
Run on the server terminal:
```
java ServerCP1
```

and on the client terminal:
```
java ClientCP1
```

you can also run the client with filenames as command line arguments like so:
```
java ClientCP1 100.txt 1000.txt 5000.txt
```


### For CP2
Run on the server terminal:
```
java ServerCP2
```

and on the client terminal:
```
java ClientCP2
```
you can also run the client with filenames as command line arguments like so:
```
java ClientCP2 100.txt 1000.txt 5000.txt

```

<i>Note: Please run the server before the client.</i>

## Specifications

## Output
The output files are named recv_<your_filename>
Multiple output files will be produced if multiple input files are specified in the command line.
